# Web Application Development - Final assignment

### School: Lernia Stockholm, Sweden.

### Program: JavaScript Developer - Front End, YHJUST16.

### Course: Web Application Development.

#### Technologies

* HTML for structure.
* CSS for design.
* Bootstrap 3 for additional structure/styling.
* jQuery for functionality.
* Git for version control.

#### API

[Unofficial Overwatch API](https://api.lootbox.eu/documentation "Unofficial Overwatch API")

In the lack of an official Overwatch API from Blizzard, the community has developed one themselves. It's not advanced and its pretty slow, but it gets the job done.

#### Description

A single page application where you can fetch your stats in the game Overwatch, using a community made API in wait for an official version Enter your Battletag, select region, select platform, choose game mode and use the fetch buttons to get your stats! If you don't have a battletag, fear not! Use one of these sample tags:

* MOONMOON#1629, PC, US
* Seagull#1894, PC, US

#### Workflow

I made this web application with Mobile-first in mind, since Bootstrap is a mobile-first framework. It scales pretty well and looks alright in modern browsers. I have not tested Internet Explorer yet, though.

#### Potential future improvements

Will enter info here once I'm finished
